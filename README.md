# fusee-beheaded
A headless payload injector script for Linux. Meant to be used for making DIY payload injector devices. The idea is that you make it run at startup (if you trust me...) and it automatically injects [`hekatemod`](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/) (or whatever other payload, I guess. But try out [`hekatemod`](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/), it's awesome.)


# How to use

> âš  This is not meant for a regular Linux desktop or server! If you have that setup and want to inject something, check out [web-fusee-launcher](https://github.com/atlas44/web-fusee-launcher) or [fusee-interfacee-tk]!

If you have realised that this is for embedded, headless (beheaded, headless, get it?) devices RUNNING GNU/LINUX, proceed to the below steps:

1. Find a victim: Find an innocent, usable Raspberry Pi (or maybe an Arduino, idk man), and make it be a payload injector. This may take some convincing on your part, since this is a famously terrible way for tiny PC's to go. (Or not, I'm just some rando on the Internet.). Once you've persuaded your pesky Pi to give up all of its hopes, dreams, and/or dignity, figure it out. 

Yeah, I haven't put any code here, so no instructions for you. ðŸ‘¿
